# SDE Bitmaps

## What is this?

This repo is intended to fill a potential gap in available open-source libraries for using bitmaps in Smart Contracts.

Bitmaps can be an effective way to manage boolean states in a extremely gas-efficient manner. However, currently available tooling seems limited and lacks off-chain helpers that allow a developer to test their own implementation.

Work is very much in progress; collaboration, PRs, and advice are welcome!
